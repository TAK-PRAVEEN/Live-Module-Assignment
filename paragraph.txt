Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines. It encompasses various techniques, including machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing. AI systems can analyze data, recognize patterns, and make decisions without explicit programming. From chatbots to self-driving cars, AI has transformed industries, enabling automation, personalization, and efficiency. However, ethical considerations, bias, and transparency remain critical challenges in its development and deployment. As AI continues to evolve, its impact on society and our daily lives will undoubtedly grow.
